            <p>Machine learning (ML) is rapidly changing the world, from diverse types of applications and research
                pursued
                in
                industry and academia. Machine learning is affecting every part of our daily lives. From voice
                assistants
                using NLP
                and machine learning to make appointments, check our calendar, and play music, to programmatic
                advertisements
                — that are so accurate that they can predict what we will need before we even think of it.More often
                than
                not,
                the complexity of the scientific field of machine learning can be overwhelming, making keeping up
                with “what
                is important”
                a very challenging task. However, to make sure that we provide a learning path to those who seek to
                learn
                machine learning,
                but are new to these concepts. In this article we look at the most critical basic algorithms that
                hopefully
                make your
                machine learning journey less .</p>

                A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and
                performance
                measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. ~ Tom M.
                Mitchell
                [1]

                Machine learning behaves similarly to the growth of a child. As a child grows, her experience E in
                performing task T increases, which results in higher performance measure (P).

                For instance, we give a “shape sorting block” toy to a child. (Now we all know that in this toy, we have
                different shapes and shape holes). In this case, our task T is to find an appropriate shape

                hole for a shape. Afterward, the child observes the shape and tries to fit it in a shaped hole. Let us
                say
                that this toy has three shapes: a circle, a triangle, and a square. In her first attempt at finding

                a shaped hole, her performance measure(P) is 1/3, which means that the child found 1 out of 3 correct
                shape
                holes.

                Second, the child tries it another time and notices that she is a little experienced in this task.
                Considering the experience gained (E), the child tries this task another time, and when

                measuring the performance(P), it turns out to be 2/3. After repeating this task (T) 100 times, the baby
                now
                figured out which shape goes into which shape hole.

                So her experience (E) increased, her performance(P) also increased, and then we notice that as the
                number of
                attempts at this toy increases. The performance also increases, which results in higher accuracy.

                Such execution is similar to machine learning. What a machine does is, it takes a task (T), executes it,
                and
                measures its performance (P). Now a machine has a large number of data, so as it processes that

                data, its experience (E) increases over time, resulting in a higher performance measure (P). So after
                going
                through all the data, our machine learning model’s accuracy increases, which means that the predictions
                made
                by our model will be very accurate.

                Now, we have to make such a set of rules for every data point. Furthermore, we place a decision tree of
                if,
                else if, else statements and check whether it falls into one of the categories.

                Let us assume that the result of this experiment was not fruitful as it misclassified many of the
                animals,
                which gives us an excellent opportunity to use machine learning.

                What machine learning does is process the data with different kinds of algorithms and tells us which
                feature
                is more important to determine whether it is a cat or a dog. So instead of applying many sets of rules,
                we
                can simplify it based on two or three features, and as a result, it gives us a higher accuracy. The
                previous
                method was not generalized enough to make predictions.

            What is a machine learning model?
            A machine learning model is a question/answering system that takes care of processing machine-learning
            related
            tasks. Think of it as an algorithm system that represents data when solving problems. The methods we will
            tackle
            below are beneficial for industry-related purposes to tackle business problems.

            For instance, let us imagine that we are working on Google Adwords’ ML system, and our task is to
            implementing
            an ML algorithm to convey a particular demographic or area using data. Such a task aims to go from using
            data to
            gather valuable insights to improve business outcomes. <>&nbsp;<br>

                    <strong> Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong>
                    Artificial intelligence (AI), as defined by Professor Andrew Moore, is the science and engineering
                    of
                    making
                    computers behave in ways that, until recently, we thought required human intelligence [4].

                    </ul><br>
                    <strong> Machine Learning (ML):</strong>
                    As defined by Professor Tom Mitchell, machine learning refers to a scientific branch of AI, which
                    focuses on the
                    study of computer algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through
                    experience
                    [3]. <br>

                        <li> Clustering</li>
                    </ul>
                    <strong> Deep Learning:</strong>
                    Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in which layered neural networks, combined with high
                    computing
                    power and large datasets, can create powerful machine learning models. [3]
